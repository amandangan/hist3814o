# Annotation Reflection
I found this [annotation](https://hyp.is/Pp8FBlS6Eei8rovnq-0Dhw/historyonics.blogspot.com/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html) from last week's readings very fascinating. It was a response to the fact that the majority of our records come from [rich, white men (and sometimes women)](http://historyonics.blogspot.ca/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html). *Shaylshola* mentioned how there is a dent in representation, and that it is biased and non-inclusive, all of which I agreed with. It's extremely important that we recognize all forms of diversity in history, and that try to continue to expand our knowledge by looking at it through different [lens](http://www.themacroscope.org/2.0/diversity-in-digital-history/). 

I also found an article that addressed an issue regarding [diversity](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/april-2000/on-diversity-in-history) and I found it really interesting. It addressed an issue that pertained to historians feeling unappreciated and excluded from the American Historical Association, particularly due to the rise in diverse history. 

All the history that I learned, and that I saw many other classmates mention they learned, was from a westernized point of view, or it was very European-centric. Having them point this out really made me think of past history classes I have took in high school and university, and how the perspective is always from a European point of view, unless I was taking a history course specifically focused on a different country. I took a look online to see what undergraduate history programs are currenly like now (as I entered university 5 years ago, and things have shifted a little bit), and I was pleased to see that some schools offer [history programs](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/arts/history/programs/undergraduate-programs/diversityhistory.html) that specifically focus in diverse history, ensuring that there are history courses from all over the world. 

I think that this struck with me because growing up I didn't think too much about where I came from, or why my parents moved from Hong Kong to Canada, all of which is very important for our family history. It wasn't until I got into university that I started asking more questions about why we moved, where my parents lived in Hong Kong, what their lives were like here, and even trying to find out more information as to where our family originated from in China (Canton!) I've come to realize that I want to learn more, and that I think it is extremely important to learn about your own family history. I want to be able to keep this information and be able to pass this onto future generations. 

I also wanted to point out something interesting. While looking for images that relate to my writings, I searched 'historians' using Creative Commons and looked at the Wikimedia Commons. On the first page were about 20 photos and the majority of the images that showed up were all male historians. ![Dr. Joseph Klausner](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Young_Dr_Joseph_Klausner.jpg) Other results had to do with a specific country's historians, and only one of the pictures had a female historian on it (next to a male historian). ![Dr. Suzanne Junod](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/FDA_Historians_%2813267905805%29.jpg) Just simply searching for images already gave me results that reflected similarly to the comments made above.
