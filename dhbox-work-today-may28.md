I searched 'magister' in the Epigraphic Database. I got 210 results including some images of different inscriptions. This is one of the things I found: http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD003617/iiif#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&r=0&xywh=-112%2C9%2C2222%2C1888
In the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, I searched my last name and got 6 results. Not surprising given my unique last name. The file I downloaded from this search will be located in my GitHub.
